# rwalk

This package is under development.

This is, as of yet, a minimal build with incomplete documentation.

The package rwalk consists of tools for random walks and Schmitz/Sulzer modified random walks for simulations of electrochemical detection of neurotransmitter release and reuptake. Developed with the Sulzer Lab at Columbia University.
